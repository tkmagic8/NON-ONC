Nursing Orders	
Verify that patient meets the lab parameters for administration. 
Begin 0.9% saline as primary line to keep vein open. 
Perform assessment for toxicity and tolerance.
Consult MD for new pregnancy, temperature greater than 100.4F (38C), symptoms of acute viral or bacterial illness, if patient is taking antibiotics for current infection, symptoms of abscess or bowel obstruction.
Filter infliximab (or biosimilar) with an in-line, low protein-binding-filter of 1.2 micron or less.
Begin infliximab (or biosimilar) infusion at 10 mL/hr for 15 min, then increase to 20 mL/hr for 15 min, then 40 mL/hr for 15 min, then 80 mL/hr for 15 min, then 150 mL/hr for 15 min, then 250 mL/hr until infusion is complete.  Note:  The entire dose of infliximab (or biosimilar) may be given over 30 to 60 minutes at the discretion of the nurse if the patient has met and tolerated the following dosing protocol: If patient tolerates at least 4 consecutive infusions over 2 hours with no evidence of infusion reaction, and agrees to rapid infusions, then administer at least 4 consecutive doses over 1 hour with 1 hour observation. If 1 hour infusions are tolerated without reactions, then remainder of doses may be administered over 30 minutes and observe post infusion per nurse's discretion.
Infusion related reactions: STOP infusion immediately, and begin primary solution at wide open rate, notify MD, begin monitoring vital signs and administer prn medication for infusion reaction; 20 minutes after symptoms have resolved, the infusion may be reinstituted at 10 mL/hour; then increased at 15-minute intervals, as tolerated, to completion (initial increase 20 mL/hour, then 40 mL/hour, then 80 mL/hour, etc [maximum of 125 mL/hour]).
